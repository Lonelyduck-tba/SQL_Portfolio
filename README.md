# SQL Portfolio

This is my repository. In here are a collection of SQL projects and queries.

**SQL Projects**

Listed below are the projects I've worked on:
  1. [Investigating the Solar and Wind Generation using an NESO Dataset](https://github.com/Lonelyduck-tba/Investigating-the-Solar-and-Wind-Generation-using-an-NESO-Dataset). : In this project I aimed to investigate the historic electricity demand, wind and solar outturn data for 2023. This dataset was sourced from the Nation Energy System Operator which is a licensed electricity system operator balancing supply and demand; residing within Great Britain. The project is pretty small and consists of a very simple SQL query.
